refactor(ui): update component imports and enhance audio elements

- Updated import paths for various UI components to use the new structure, ensuring consistency across the project.
- Added "sonner" as a dependency for the audio player component to support notifications.
- Refactored audio-related components to utilize the updated imports, improving maintainability and clarity.
- Removed obsolete components such as badge, button, card, dropdown-menu, input, label, progress, select, skeleton, slider, sonner, spinner, textarea, toggle, and tooltip to streamline the codebase.

These changes aim to enhance the organization of the UI package and improve the overall structure of the audio components.
